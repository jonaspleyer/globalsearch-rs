@article{ugray,
  abstract = {The algorithm described here, called OptQuest/NLP or OQNLP, is a heuristic designed to find global optima for pure and mixed integer nonlinear problems with many constraints and variables, where all problem functions are differentiable with respect to the continuous variables. It uses OptQuest, a commercial implementation of scatter search developed by OptTek Systems, Inc., to provide starting points for any gradient-based local solver for nonlinear programming (NLP) problems. This solver seeks a local solution from a subset of these points, holding discrete variables fixed. The procedure is motivated by our desire to combine the superior accuracy and feasibility-seeking behavior of gradient-based local NLP solvers with the global optimization abilities of OptQuest. Computational results include 155 smooth NLP and mixed integer nonlinear program (MINLP) problems due to Floudas et al. (1999), most with both linear and nonlinear constraints, coded in the GAMS modeling language. Some are quite large for global optimization, with over 100 variables and 100 constraints. Global solutions to almost all problems are found in a small number of local solver calls, often one or two. },

@article{airfoil,
  abstract = {A new and effective uncertainty optimization design framework based on adaptive point adding strategy is proposed to design and optimize the supercritical airfoil which is sensitive to Mach number variation. The new framework combines non-intrusive polynomial chaos (NIPC) method, Kriging model, lower confidence bounding (LCB) infill criterion, and global GlobalSearch algorithm. NIPC method is used to quantify the uncertainty of Mach number. A new class/shape function transformation method is used to parameterize the airfoil shapes and Kriging model is selected to establish the surrogate model of the aerodynamic optimization design. The LCB infill criterion is proposed to update the initial surrogate model by adding the optimal design point. The global GlobalSearch algorithm is used to optimize the surrogate model. The uncertainty optimization results are compared with the deterministic optimization results. It is shown that the proposed uncertainty optimization design based on adaptive point adding strategy has higher robustness under condition of Mach number variation, the optimization expense can be reduced to 20.76%, and the efficiency of optimization design is improved.},

@article{kinetics,
  abstract = {Accurate thermal decomposition mechanism and kinetic parameters are helpful to analyze the combustion process of flexible polyurethane foam. The thermal decomposition process of flexible polyurethane foam products (amine derivatives) was ignored in the past. Three thermal decomposition mechanisms of flexible polyurethane foam were proposed according to the thermogravimetry experiment of flexible polyurethane foam in the nitrogen atmosphere, two of which included the thermal decomposition of amine derivatives. The global search algorithm was proposed to estimate the kinetic parameters of the thermal decomposition of solid material. The results show that the global search algorithm is efficient and accurate in estimating kinetic parameters. The results also show the thermal decomposition mechanism including the carbodiimide and polycarbondiimide can well describe the thermal decomposition process of flexible polyurethane foam and amine derivatives. The activation energy, pre-exponential factor, and reaction order of flexible polyurethane foam are 187.3 kJ mol−1, 1015.6 s−1, and 1.22, respectively. },

@article{drones7080487,
  abstract       = {In this paper, we propose a set of guidelines to select a solver for the solution of nonlinear programming problems. We conduct a comparative analysis of the convergence performances of commonly used solvers for both unconstrained and constrained nonlinear programming problems. The comparison metrics involve accuracy, convergence rate, and computational time. MATLAB is chosen as the implementation platform due to its widespread adoption in academia and industry. Our study includes solvers which are either freely available or require a license, or are extensively documented in the literature. Moreover, we differentiate solvers if they allow the selection of different optimal search methods. We assess the performance of 24 algorithms on a set of 60 benchmark problems. We also evaluate the capability of each solver to tackle two large-scale UAV optimal path planning scenarios, specifically the 3D minimum time problem for UAV landing and the 3D minimum time problem for UAV formation flying. To enrich our analysis, we discuss the effects of each solver’s inner settings on accuracy, convergence rate, and computational time.},
